  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I graduated from University of California San Diego (UCSD)
    with a B.S. Computer Science in 2017. My original major was Electical Engineer, however
  after taking a introductory coding class, I was hooked. I enjoyed the methods and process of programming and
wanted to do more. I applied to the Computer Science major after a year and got in. Of course, being a year behind,
I had to put in plenty of work to be able to keep up with my peers. I persevered and eventually earned my degree
in June 2017. </p>
